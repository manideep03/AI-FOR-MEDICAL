<h1>Linear prognostic models</h1>

AI is transforming the practice of medicine. It’s helping doctors diagnose patients more accurately, make predictions about patients’ future health, and recommend better treatments. This Specialization will give you practical experience in applying machine learning to concrete problems in medicine. Machine learning is a powerful tool for prognosis, a branch of medicine that specializes in predicting the future health of patients.

Predicting riskness of ***Diabetic Retinopathy*** using linear ***LogisticRegression*** model.

Model predict rick using some factors like :
* Age: (years)
* Systolic_BP: Systolic blood pressure (mmHg)
* Diastolic_BP: Diastolic blood pressure (mmHg)
* Cholesterol: (mg/DL)

Model evaluated using method called ***```C-INDEX```***.



I achived C-INDEX value about ```0.8281``` 

Model had got about ```99.65%``` accuracy.

Let's plot the coefficients to see which variables (patient features) are having the most effect.

I found ```Age``` factor will be the higest factor to cause  ***Diabetic Retinopathy***
